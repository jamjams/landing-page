		Hello, my name is Jah'melah Maat-Hotep, pronounced Juh-mee-luh Muh-aw-t Heo-tep. I am 16 years of age and an aspiring computer developer. The computer languages I have and are currently worrking on include, Javascript, PHP, HTML, and CSS. I am just starting to work on MySQL. "I suppose so," answered the Scarecrow.  "When I have brains, I shall probably like them better." "If I only had a heart, I should love them," added the Tin Woodman. "I always did like flowers," said the Lion.  "They of seem so helpless and frail.  But there are none in the forest so bright as these." They now came upon more and more of the big scarlet poppies, and fewer and fewer of the other flowers; and soon they found themselves in the midst of a great meadow of poppies.  Now it is well known that when there are many of these flowers together their odor is so powerful that anyone who breathes it falls asleep, and if the sleeper is not carried away from the scent of the flowers, he sleeps on and on forever.  But Dorothy did not know this, nor could she.
